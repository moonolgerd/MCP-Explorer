# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Steps to publish MCP Explorer to GitHub:

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
- Go to: https://github.com/new
- Repository name: `mcp-explorer`
- Description: "VS Code extension for discovering and managing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers"
- Visibility: Public
- Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license

### 2. Add GitHub Remote and Push
Once you create the repository, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mcp-explorer.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

### 3. Repository Settings (Optional)
After pushing, you can:
- Add topics/tags: `vscode-extension`, `mcp`, `model-context-protocol`, `typescript`
- Enable GitHub Pages if you want to host documentation
- Set up branch protection rules
- Configure GitHub Actions for CI/CD

### 4. VS Code Marketplace (Future)
To publish to VS Code Marketplace:
- Install vsce: `npm install -g vsce`
- Package: `vsce package`
- Publish: `vsce publish`
